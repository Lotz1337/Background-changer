# Background-changer
Project Description
My second GitHub project! This project is a simple web page that serves as a practical exercise in JavaScript. The main feature of this page is the ability to dynamically change the background color and font color by clicking on various buttons. It's a fun and interactive way to explore how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the appearance of a web page in real-time.

Features
Colorful Buttons: The page features a series of colorful buttons, each representing a different color theme.

Background Color Change: When you click on one of the buttons, the background color of the entire page changes to match the selected theme.

Font Color Change: To ensure readability, the font color is automatically adjusted to contrast with the background, providing a visually pleasing experience.

Interactive and Responsive: The page is designed to be interactive and responsive, allowing users to experiment with different color combinations and see immediate results.
